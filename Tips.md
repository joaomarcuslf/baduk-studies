## Next move on confuse board state

When you are in doubt about what to do next in a situation, try to tenuki and change the situation on the board.

Maybe later, with more stones around things will become easier to handle and a solution might be presented to you.

## Invasion/Reduction

- If the opponent's stones are on the fourth line, then an invasion is easier.
- If the opponent's stones are on the third line, then a reduction is easier.

# Pratical rules
Those tips come from "A Go guide by a beginner", by Haris Kapolos.

- When you are trying to invade, the more helping stones you have, the better chances you have to get a good result out of the invasion. Moves that create multiple threats or miai situations are usually crucial in a successful invasion.
- When you are in doubt about what to do next in a situation, try to tenuki (play elsewhere) and change the situation on the board. Maybe later, with more stones around things will become easier to handle and a solution might be presented to you.
- The sector line is the imaginary line that connects the edges of a player’s framework. Invading behind that line could be very difficult to work, so you should always try to have nearby stones to help you achieve that goal, if you are going to try it.
- If you cannot deal with an invasion directly, try to first destabilise the opponent’s helping stones. If you can alter the board around them, then the invasion might be easier to fend off.
- Avoid creating many and small groups here and there on the board. A big successful invasion that results in a strong group for you, is usually better than many smaller ones that get chased
around the board, by your opponent.
- Do not be greedy! Until you have enough experience to know when your groups and stones are safe, try to make certain that your stones are safe before moving to the next area of interest. A group that is in danger is a much worse problem than your opponent getting some points uncontested.
- When your opponent is attaching a stone directly to one of your stones, making a contact play, the safest choice is to nobi instead of playing the hane and giving the ability to your opponent to hane as well and cut your stones, unless you have many stones to help you with such a brass move, playing the hane could mean more trouble for you than your opponent. This also means that when you play the contact play, you might be happy  if he is too aggressive and plays the hane against you.
