PW[White]PB[Black]C[San-ren-sei, which means “three star points in a row” and it is very different compared to the other fusekis.

Its main difference is that the Sen-ren-sei does not create any sort of imbalance between our stones and it is perfectly symmetrical. 

The second, and very important, difference is that it does not create any sort of trap either. 

It is, as the name implies, three stones in a row, but those stones complement each other
perfectly. Let us see what it is and how it works:]

Where the Triangle is marked, are corner approaches that White won't have decent enough result to be consid-
ered playable.

Usually those approaches would be benefecial if the WHite player didn't like framework vs framework games, but with the Q10, those approaches will give good results for Black.

Black stone at S3 provides to Black the ability to play
the monkey jump at A and destroy most of
White’s eye space

The iron pillar at R10 is still looming on the side of the White group and the only 
solution to avoid being surrounded is to start jumping out towards the center, 
giving more influence and territory to Black.

This is a terrible result for White.

Look at Black. He already has a secured corner and all his stones are either connecting or
facing each other, working together. White in comparison has two corners ready to be 
approached and a weak group that needs to run])
