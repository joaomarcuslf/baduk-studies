;W[nq]LB[pn:C][qn:D][np:B][lq:A]C[Black has four usual choices:

Choice A is the pincer and it leads to Black losing the corner, but gaining a wall, 
which might be a good idea, but White keeps sente and can approach the other corner 
of the Sanrensei immediately.

Choice B the attachment joseki which is aiming to gain the corner and a small wall, but White also keeps sente.

And choices C and D, which are similar, designed to secure as much territory as possible and l
ead the game to a framework battle which, at this point, would be in favour of Black, since he would end any varia-
tion of those joseki in sente for him.]

;W[kq]LB[fc:A][nc:F][cf:B][cj:D][dj:E][cn:C]C[After both players finish the joseki, Black now has sente, and gets to decide
what kind of game is going to be played.

If Black chooses A or F then this game is going to be a framework battle for the sides and the center, with Black
being slightly ahead due to the San-ren-sei.

If Black chooses B, C, D or E, then the frameworks are being split and the game is going to be oriented more on
local battles, with a focus on invasions and heavy fighting.])
(;B[np]C[Attachment joseki is choosen in this variation.

It isn't the best result for Black.]

The square marked points are what Black can consider as almost solid territory, since his stones are very thick and
invading seems daunting. On the other hand the triangle marked points are what White got out of this exchange.

At first glance this seems like a great result for Black, but since White still has sente, the effect is diminished because
White can play a San-ren-sei of his own at A now, placing the pressure on Black to attack that same fuseki.

(;B[lq]C[In this variation, Black will pincer White. Bus as this isn't the direction of the Sanrensei, it will leave weakness at Black's shape.]

C in a reduction of Black influence
