;B[jp]LB[pn:C][qn:D][po:A][qo:B]C[The Kobayashi fuseki which was invented by the Japanese professional player Kobayashi Koichi 9-dan.

All the moves played furing this fuseki looks very normal.

But this last move is the trick for Kobayashi fuseki, it stands in the right place for many josekis for the 3-4 approach.

If White plays at A or B, it will become an trap for White if it doesn't know the fuseki.

If the White player knows the fuseki it will play at C or D which is a small victory for Black as it already pushed White back.]

;W[pi]LB[ml:F][nl:E][mm:A][nm:B][mn:C][on:D]C[Once White does the regular approach, Black immediately pincers Whiteâ€™s stone with a two space pincer.

If White chooses to follow the joseki blindly he finds himself in this situation.

In the normal joseki, Whit's stones would have created a wall and White at Q11 would have applied pressure to the lonely Q8.

Black would in the normal joski do somethin to protec White, but as white should be strong enough, it would be hard.

Bu know, K4 is in Whit's way, and Brack will be able to protect Q8 while attacking Whit's group, and probably kill it.]

This kind of peaceful variation is the only way Whit has to get a semi-balanced result.]

;W[ql]LB[fc:C][qf:B][qj:A][fo:D]C[Black almost never does that, since the very point of the Kobayashi fuseki is to be aggressive on the
approaching stone, but even if White finds an opponent so accommodating, notice that the marked stone,
once again, turns the joseki in favour of Black and that Black also has sente. 

Now Black can either play:

A to keep up the pressure
B to enclose a corner
C to approach a corner and expand 
D to enlarge his framework. Black is not unhappy with the result, even in this case.]))
