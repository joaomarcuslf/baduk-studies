PW[White]PB[Black]LB[cd:B][dd:A]C[This is my Joseki Dictionary, I hope this help someone other than myself.

I began studying those josekis with the book "A Go guide by a beginner" by Haris Kapolos. I mix some of its comments with some of mine, after
some time, I hope to fill more with my own views.

A is a 4-4 Starting point
B is a 3-4 Starting point]
(;B[dd]LB[cc:B][fc:A]C[This is one of the most common starting move, and focus on influence more than territory. Also called Hoshi.

A is Knight approach
B is 3-3 invasion]N[4-4]
(;W[fc]LB[cc:A][ec:B][hc:F][ic:G][fd:E][hd:H][id:I][cf:C][df:D]C[A and B aim at taking up the corner territory.

C, D and E aim at developing the left side, as well as keeping half the corner

F, G, H and I are called pincers because their main goal is to focus on the top side and deprive the Black stone 
of the possibility of making a base and developing.

By far the most usual responses to the knight’s move approach are C and F.]N[Knight Approach]
(;B[cc]
;W[fe]
;B[dg]LB[cf:B][df:A][cg:C]C[Not the best response, because it gives a nice result for the player that makes the approach.

White 3 is almost a certainty. 

Now White can play on the other side of the Black stones since he will be able to connect his stones, 
so Black needs to respond. Blackcan play A, B or C, but all those moves are too passive, 
compared to move 4 on the diagram, which secures the corner territory and defends as much of the side as possible.

A two space extension might seem too large, but Black is safe...]

from the top left corner and side, he extends with move 5,
from both of his stones with a very large knight’s move.

That is a stable move when played on the side of the board
and Black cannot invade in White’s area, in the same manner 
White couldn’t break into Black’s area. 

Black might be thinking that he got the best deal, but if we were to actually
count the points that these moves seem to have secured for each player, 
we will see that they are practically the same!

What is different is the shape and the whole board situation. Usually White’s shape is now easier to expand from, 
assuming that he approached from the right direction.])
(;B[ec]C[This move is aiming to give a nice result in the corner, but it leaves a lot of defects open for a counter-attack later on. This makes it being played when the defender has another helping stone.]
;W[fd]
;B[cf]
;W[jc])
(;B[cf]C[This move is aiming to create a balanced result where both players get nearly
half of everything they want and the only big advantage for the player who was
approached is that he now gets sente and the ability to gain the upper hand
elsewhere.

The small knight’s move response is one of the smallest, easiest and balanced joseki in the
game. Not only does it give a balanced result to both players, but it is also forgiving enough in case a player
does not complete all the moves of the joseki.]
(;W[db]LB[cc:A]C[Most common response, it Aims to attack point A.]
;B[cc]LB[ic:A][jc:D][id:B][jd:C]C[White wants to avoid getting surrounded, so he cannot
afford to let Black play any move around A, B, C, or D,
so White usually plays in one of those points, with A and
B being the most safe and thus the most common choices
that conclude the joseki.]
(;W[ic])
(;W[kd]LB[ic:A][id:B][jd:C]C[For example, playing on the side star point seems to be a
faster and more powerful move, but it has three weak
points for invasion at A, B and C.]))
(;W[cc]C[Not a good response.]
;B[dc]
;W[db]
;B[eb]
;W[cb]
;B[ec]C[If White jumps into the 3-3 point, he gets immediately separated from his initial stone and
Black’s knight’s move at 2 is in the perfect place to intercept White’s expansion.]))
(;B[df]C[This move has the exact same idea behind it like the Knight’s move response(C),
but it gives more emphasis to the center instead of the corner. Indeed most of the
variations we just analysed for the Knight’s move response could remain the same,
apart from the fact that now White can threaten to attack Black’s formation directly.]
;W[db]
;B[cc]
;W[ic]LB[be:A][cg:B][ch:D][ck:C]C[A, B, C, D are possible weakness of this formation.

The one space jump response seems inferior to the Knight’s move response, on an empty
board. The only time it is more advantageous is when we already have some stones on the side we try to
jump towards. Those help us cover the one space jump response main weakness, which is the 3rd line at-
tack we analysed. If White has a stone around the star point in that side, then this joseki is better than the
Knight’s move response. If not then you should avoid playing it or strive to exploit it.])
(;B[fd]LB[cc:B][gd:A]SQ[ab][ac][bc][ad][bd][cd][ae][be][ce][de][ee][af][bf][cf][df][ef][ag][bg][cg][dg][eg]C[This move is aiming to keep the corner as well as expand towards the side.
This is a very lofty goal, so it is no surprise that it is a move that can be played only
if we have an extra stone to help us, just like with the one space extension

Black attaches on the White stone to apply the most pressure, in order to defend the side and
most of the corner. White can play the hane at A or dive for the corner at B, with A being the most usual
move.]
;W[gd]LB[fe:A]C[Once White makes the hane, Black needs to help his stone and avoid the atari at A. The
reason why we should be careful of attaching to other stones is that we put our stone in danger of getting
surrounded.]
;B[fe]LB[cc:D][dc:C][ec:A][ge:B]C[White wants to protect his own weak point at the square mark with either A or B. White can
also choose to leave it unprotected and go for the corner with C or D. 

The most usual choice is A since it is the safest]
;W[ec]LB[dc:A][ge:B]C[In which case now it is Black’s turn to decide what he wants. Black can defend his corner
and side with A or go for the side and center with B. Choosing B is rare after investing all these moves to
protect the corner.]
;B[dc]LB[hc:A][ic:B][jc:C][ge:D]C[White wants to expand now, while still protecting his cutting point so A, B, C and D are the
obvious moves towards the two directions left for White to expand. Choice B is a usual choice, 
as a concession between the safe A and the bolder C.
]
;W[ic]LB[df:A]TR[ed]C[Black is left with a cutting point in the marked spot. Black could play there, but it is a bad shape (two empty triangles) that just defends, so the table shape at A is a better move that protects the cut
and expands at the same time.]
;B[df]LB[ge:A]C[Now the joseki is complete with Black 8 and things seem to
be fairly good for Black. He got most of the corner and there
is little White can do to break up Black’s formation and he has
the ability to expand on the left side or the center side at A.
White, on the other hand, got some points on the top side and
he can keep expanding towards the right side or go out in the
center at A.

The point at A is a central point of focus for both players, so
sometimes you might see either one of them try to play there
as soon as possible.


])
(;B[hc]LB[cc:A][fe:B]C[This move is aiming to emphasize the side from which your opponent is trying
to approach you. It gives your opponent the choice to either take the corner and give
up the side from which he originally approached, or give up approaching the corner
and focus on that side as well. The first choice is the most effective for the person
trying to approach, but sometimes the side is so important that he needs to stop the
approach and defend the side.

After Black’s pincer at move 2, White can either invade the corner at A or jump out at B.]
;W[cc]
;B[dc]LB[cd:A]C[if the left side is more important, but the most reasonable choice
is move 4, which splits the White stones]
;W[cd]LB[ce:B][de:A]C[White 6 tried to extend the stones and create a base in the corner. Black can either extend at A or hane at B, 
like in the joseki in 3-3 invasion joseki, but in this case, due to the White 2 the hane is a mistake.]
;B[de]
;W[db]LB[eb:A]C[After Black extends, White 8 uses his move 1 to threaten to connect underneath Black’s stones. 

Black, of course cannot allow that to happen so playing at A is a certain move without any other
practical alternatives.]
;B[eb]
;W[cb]
;B[ec]LB[bf:B][cf:A]C[Black 9 defends and White 10 connects White’s group. Black 11 also connects Black’s
stones and now White can easily make two eyes and live in the corner by either playing A or B.]
;W[cf]
;B[eg]
;W[cg]C[If White plays the more aggressive choice in move 11, Black usually creates a large wall
with move 12, while minimizing any chances of White’s stone 1 to run away later. Move 13
solidifies White’s group concluding the joseki.]))
(;W[cc]LB[dc:B][cd:A]TR[ec][fc][ed][fd][ce][de][cf][df]C[When White plays 1, Black can either choose A or B, 
depending on which marked side he wants to defend and develop.]N[3-3 Invasion]
;B[cd]
;W[dc]LB[ec:A][fc:B]TR[ce][de][ee][cf][df][ef]C[Usually Black chooses the side which is facing towards the corner
which he has stones in. Black can now choose A or B.

Choice B is designed to take sente.]

going at 5 and extend again with 7 when Black
plays the obvious moves at 6 and 8 to keep White
low while protecting his own cutting point at the
O marked spot. Now White is alive, so he can play
9 away at A, B, C or D to reduce Black’s influence and threaten the marked cutting point.]))
(;B[cd]LB[ec:B][fc:C][ed:A][fd:D][cf:E][cg:F]C[The other most popular move in the opening is playing in the 3-4 point, also called komoku. This
choice mainly focus on territory. 

Some thought on the whole board situation and the direction of play is needed and even from the
first moves we are forced to think about what we want to do on the board and where.

A and B are the most popular approaches with dozens of variations
and joseki springing from them, since they are moves that have been
around for thousands of years.

C and D are wider and safer ways to approach the 3-4 stone in case
we want our approach to be more flexible.

E and F are moves that are chosen when we want to avoid approach-
ing the 3-4 point from its usual side, at all costs.]N[3-4]
;W[ed]LB[ec:A][gc:H][dd:F][gd:I][hd:B][ee:G][cf:D][df:C][cg:E]C[For this response, we have a great number of variations>

A, F and G aim at starting a fight and usually aim at
taking the corner territory.

C, D and E are peaceful options that aim at developing
the left side, as well as keeping part of the corner, with-
out engaging the approaching stone

B, H and I are the most usual pincers and their main
goal, just like before, is to focus on the top side and de-
prive the Withe to.

Comment for the pincers, when the board is empty, it is very strong response for the defender, the attacker should be ready for this response.]N[One space jump]
(;B[ec]LB[fc:A][dd:C][fd:B]C[After the White's approach, Black responds with Knight approach.

On this scenario, White can either pressure black on E-17 by reducint it's liberties with A, or Indirect attacking E-17 with B or C.]
;W[fc]LB[eb:B][dc:A][dd:C][fd:D]C[Black cannot ignore White move, because it can become an atari, so moves like C or D are not good, and A and B have the same idea of strengthen Black's corner.]
;B[dc]LB[fd:A][gd:B]C[After that, White has an cutting point at A, he can protect with A or B.

B can create more space in future moves.]
;W[gd]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[A focus on territory
B focus on influence]
;B[cf]LB[jc:B][jd:A]C[Like Black had before, White next moves can either focus on territory with B, or on influence with A.

This is a really fair Joseki, with Black having the corner, and the possibility to extend on the side, and White has a nice moyo potential.

If white had a helping stone on the side it approached, it would create and splendid result, but even without it, it is a fair result.])
(;B[hd]LB[cc:A][ce:E][ef:B][dg:D][eg:C]C[This move is very common in the game and you should expect to encounter it;

It is a response that is viewed as very annoying for the player who approaches and 
it is used in the Kobayashi fuseki. 

The main problem created by this response is that the defending
stone is standing exactly on the spot that the approaching player initially hoped to
develop, creating a very interesting variation.

After the pincer, White cannot really extend or develop towards that side for the time being. 
His stone is now weak and without a base so, before White can deal with Black’s move at the pincer,
he needs to strengthen his own stone. For that exact reason, A is not the best joseki, but, 
despite that, it is a very common move.

White’s most effective choices for that goal are B, C, D and E.

Choices B, C and D are jumps that aim to give more space to White’s stone so that he can launch an attack to Black's pincer.

Choice E is usually played when White has a favorable ladder and it leads to joseki that has so many variations that 
it has the illustrious name the “magic sword of Muramasa”.]

;B[bc]C[Black is threatening to atari the White stone and defends the
corner.]
;W[dc]C[White extends to avoid the atari threat and to connect all his
stones.]
;B[be]LB[gc:B][ef:A]C[Those are natural responses, or obvious responses.

Black is stabilizing Black’s group making it alive and giving it the ability to expand towards the bottom side.

Now White can either jump at A or live at B...

But both choices are not very good for White. 

If White tries to live with B, he only has a small area, while Black is
expanding in both sides and can still harass and threaten White’s group later.

If White jumps, now Black has a stable corner from which to expand and can jump all the way to
D-13. 

White still has no eyes and Black’s stone at H-16 is still a thorn at his side.]

(;W[ef]LB[cf:A][cg:B]C[White chooses to jump out first in order to threaten to get away from the pincer from either side.

Bllack must defend his corner stone first since Black’s stone at H-16 is still very flexible, but a corner stone cannot
be left without help since its proximity with the edge of the board make it less flexible than a side stone. 

So, Black has to jump as well and follow White. 
Both A and B are possible, but A is more stable and safe as a choice, in order to strengthen the corner and the left side.]
;B[cf]
;W[eh]
;B[ch]LB[cc:A][jd:C][kd:B]C[After Black jumps, White repeats the one space jump with exactly the same idea in mind. 

If Black ignores him, White can get away from both sides.

Black has the same problems as before and he has to defend the corner and the left side at the same time,
so he jumps again.

Now White has three choices, A, B and C.

Choice A aims at the corner, but is not considered enough of a threat now that Black jumped twice, so White can ignore it and play a move to strengthen his stone at H-16.

So, White usually plays either B or C to pincer the Black stone against his wall and profit by attacking Black’s
weak stone]))
(;B[df]CR[jd]LB[cc:A][ef:B]C[This response is very peaceful, it avoids fighting and complicated sequences. Usually getting an balanced result.

For this response, we have A and B.

B is better if white has and helping stone at the side it approached, like where the circle is.

The knight’s move extension is a peaceful joseki choice to settle the corner without many
complications. When used in normal situations it is very balanced, but when the defending player has
other stones nearby to help him, then it can become a trap for the approaching player.]
