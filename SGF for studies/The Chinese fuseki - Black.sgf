in this case White stone is almost already pincered.

side next, but now the Black stone is cutting his development there, so White can either
jump away at A or try the right side anyway with B. 

Meanwhile Black secured a very large corner and White’s group doesn’t have a base yet.

Both choices are bad for White, compared to the result Black gets.]

and gaining points without much trouble.])
