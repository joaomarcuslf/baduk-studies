;B[ok]LB[jn:A][fo:D][hp:B][hq:C][lq:E]C[This result is actually decent for Black, but White has an decent moio and has some weak spots in Black's territory to attack.

A and D aim at reducing Black’s moio
B, C and E are directly invading that moio to destroy it

White doesn’t have to play those moves for them to be dangerous.

He could threaten to play them, by playing near those moves and thus force Black to
waste some of his moves to defend the weak points.])

Black cannot be complacent despite the territory he gained.

It has almost the same weakeness from the previous variation.

Even though E changed to a reducing move, rather than a direct invasion.

White can also play F and try to capitalize on his wall and later approach Black’s corner.]))
