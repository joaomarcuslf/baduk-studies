;B[qk]C[So, while playing as White, the Cinese Fuseki there is no weakness for human. AlphaGo has an possible solution, but is far more complex
to put here. The bes way to deal with the Chinese Fuseki is to ignore it for now and play somewhere else, like the following.]

;W[kc]LB[cn:B][fq:A]C[After this Black will usually play at A trying to expand his own framework, since this is the
most obvious and beneficial direction of play for him. 

If Black dislikes the idea of having a framework vs framework game, then he can approach White’s corner from the opposite
side, at B. It is a valid strategy, but it happens rarely compared to A.]

;W[cf]LB[jd:D][dj:C][fo:B][po:A]C[Approaching at the corner from the correct direction gives Black the chance to play the
Kobayashi fuseki as well, reinforcing the trap at his lower right corner. After such a move

White usually plays C14 to defend his own corner and then the opening is drawing to an
end. 

Both players seem to have one half of the board and their frameworks must eventually clash.

Black can play at various places:

He can play at A to take the last corner of the
game.

He can play at B to cover the weak point of the
Kobayashi fuseki.

He can play the invasion at C to split White’s
stones and disrupt White’s framework.

Or he can play at D to reduce White’s influ-
ence])
(;W[mq]C[Another idea is to approach the lower right corner, but in a non-standard way,]
;B[po]C[Usually Black will just enclose the corner with Q5 and take the territory as profit, 
since the trap he tried to set was evaded and would no longer work.]
;W[jq]LB[fc:A][nc:B][dj:D][cn:C]C[White is a standard two space jump designed to give a base to White’s group. 

After that, it is Black’s turn to choose what will happen on the board,
Black has sente and four choices:

Choice A is creating a framework vs framework game like in previous example and it is
the correct direction of play, trying to make all of Black’s stones work together.

Choice B secures the corner and focuses on Black gaining most of the right side.

Choices C and D are designed to disrupt the creation of large frameworks and split the
board in smaller groups]

;B[ic]LB[qc:C][dj:B][oj:D][pj:E][cn:A]C[The most usual choice is to create a framework, so assuming that the players use one of
the balanced joseki, the board will look like this, with White having sente.

Choices A and B strengthen White’s framework and gives sente back to Black and gives
him the responsibility to decide when the two frameworks will clash and how.

Choice C is a standard corner invasion. White gets the corner and breaks into Black’s framework while keeping
sente. It is a very tempting choice and many play it eagerly.

Choices D and E are reductions.]))
